# Project Title: Cancer Prediction Using Gene Expression Data
## Description
This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning pipeline to predict different types of cancer using gene expression data. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, the pipeline aims to identify which gene expressions have a high impact on specific cancer types.

## Key Features
. Data Analysis: Analyzed gene expression data sourced from GitHub.

. Machine Learning: Trained a Random Forest model to classify five types of cancers based on gene expression profiles.

. Pipeline Development: Built a comprehensive machine learning pipeline using Python and Google Colab.

. Bioinformatics Integration: Highlighted the crucial role of machine learning in bioinformatics, particularly in understanding gene expression and cancer prediction.
## Goals
. To accurately predict cancer types from gene expression data.

. To identify high-impact genes associated with different cancers.

. To demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in bioinformatics applications.
## Tools and Technologies
. Programming Language: Python

. Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

. Platforms: Google Colab
